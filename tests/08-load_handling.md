Load handling tests are crucial for evaluating how a system performs under a significant load of concurrent users or requests. Here are three specific examples of load handling tests, along with sample code or instructions:

1. **Example: Load Testing a Web Application (Python with Locust)**

   - **Description**: Test a web application by simulating a large number of concurrent users making HTTP requests.

   - **Test Code (Python with Locust)**:

   Install Locust using `pip install locust`.

   Create a file named `locustfile.py` with the following content:

   ```python
   from locust import HttpUser, task, between

   class WebsiteUser(HttpUser):
       wait_time = between(5, 15)  # Simulate users with random think times between requests

       @task
       def index_page(self):
           self.client.get("/")

       @task
       def about_page(self):
           self.client.get("/about")

   # To run the test, execute: locust -f locustfile.py
   ```

   In this example, we use Locust, a popular load testing tool in Python. It defines a user that simulates browsing a website with tasks to visit the home page and the about page. You can adjust the wait times and tasks based on your specific application.

   To run the test, execute `locust -f locustfile.py` in the terminal.

2. **Example: Load Testing an API (Python with Locust)**

   - **Description**: Test an API by simulating a large number of concurrent requests.

   - **Test Code (Python with Locust)**:

   Create a file named `locustfile.py` with the following content:

   ```python
   from locust import HttpUser, task, between

   class ApiUser(HttpUser):
       wait_time = between(5, 15)  # Simulate users with random think times between requests

       @task
       def get_resource(self):
           self.client.get("/api/resource")

       @task
       def post_resource(self):
           self.client.post("/api/resource", json={"data": "example"})

   # To run the test, execute: locust -f locustfile.py
   ```

   In this example, the `ApiUser` class simulates users making GET and POST requests to an API endpoint. You can customize the requests and payloads based on your specific API.

   To run the test, execute `locust -f locustfile.py` in the terminal.

3. **Example: Load Testing a Database (Python with SQLAlchemy and Locust)**

   - **Description**: Test a database by simulating a large number of concurrent queries.

   - **Test Code (Python with SQLAlchemy and Locust)**:

   Create a file named `locustfile.py` with the following content:

   ```python
   from locust import User, task, between
   from sqlalchemy import create_engine, select, MetaData, Table

   class DbUser(User):
       wait_time = between(5, 15)  # Simulate users with random think times between requests

       def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):
           super().__init__(*args, **kwargs)
           self.engine = create_engine('postgresql://username:password@localhost:5432/database')
           self.metadata = MetaData(bind=self.engine)
           self.table = Table('table_name', self.metadata, autoload=True)

       @task
       def select_query(self):
           query = select([self.table]).limit(10)
           with self.engine.connect() as conn:
               conn.execute(query)

   # To run the test, execute: locust -f locustfile.py
   ```

   In this example, the `DbUser` class simulates users making database queries. It uses SQLAlchemy to connect to a database and execute a select query.

   To run the test, execute `locust -f locustfile.py` in the terminal.

These examples demonstrate how to perform load handling tests using Locust, simulating concurrent users or requests for web applications, APIs, and databases. The provided code can be used as a starting point and customized based on specific requirements.
