Edge tests focus on evaluating how well a system handles extreme or uncommon scenarios. Here are three specific examples of edge tests for correctness:

1. **Example: Maximum Input Value**
   - **Description**: Test how the system handles the maximum allowable input value for a specific parameter.
   - **Test Case**:
     - **Input**: Find the factorial of 20
     - **Expected Output**: 2432902008176640000

   - **Edge Test Scenario**:
     1. Provide the maximum allowable input value for the factorial function.
     2. Verify that the system correctly computes and returns the result.

2. **Example: Empty Input**
   - **Description**: Test how the system handles cases where input data is missing or empty.
   - **Test Case**:
     - **Input**: Empty string for a text processing function
     - **Expected Output**: Error or appropriate response indicating empty input

   - **Edge Test Scenario**:
     1. Pass an empty string as input to the text processing function.
     2. Verify that the system handles this case appropriately, such as returning an error message or providing a clear indication of the empty input.

3. **Example: Maximum Load and Concurrent Requests**
   - **Description**: Test the system's behavior when subjected to a very high load or a large number of concurrent requests.
   - **Test Case**:
     - **Input**: Simulate 1000 simultaneous requests to a server
     - **Expected Output**: All requests are processed without system failure or significant degradation in performance

   - **Edge Test Scenario**:
     1. Use a load testing tool to simulate a large number of concurrent requests to the server.
     2. Monitor the system's response time, resource utilization, and ensure that it can handle the load without crashing or significantly slowing down.

In these examples, edge tests focus on extreme or unusual conditions that may not occur frequently in typical usage but are important to validate the robustness and resilience of the system. These tests help ensure that the system behaves appropriately under adverse conditions.
