System administration and DevOps tests assess the ability to manage and automate tasks in a system or cloud environment. Please note, these specific scripts could not be tested like other scripts in this document. Any scripts written by an LLM should be reviewed and tested just as if they were written by a human.

Here are three specific examples of tests for system administration and DevOps, along with sample code or instructions:

1. **Example: Automated Server Provisioning (Bash with AWS CLI)**

   - **Description**: Automate the process of provisioning a new server in AWS.

   - **Test Code (Bash with AWS CLI)**:

   ```bash
   # Assuming you have AWS CLI installed and configured with necessary permissions

   # Create a new EC2 instance
   instance_id=$(aws ec2 run-instances \
       --image-id ami-12345678 \
       --instance-type t2.micro \
       --key-name my-key-pair \
       --security-group-ids sg-012345678 \
       --subnet-id subnet-012345678 \
       --query 'Instances[0].InstanceId' \
       --output text)

   # Wait for the instance to be running
   aws ec2 wait instance-running --instance-ids $instance_id

   # Get public DNS name of the new instance
   public_dns=$(aws ec2 describe-instances \
       --instance-ids $instance_id \
       --query 'Reservations[0].Instances[0].PublicDnsName' \
       --output text)

   # Perform tests on the new instance (e.g., SSH into it and run commands)
   # Example: ssh -i path/to/your-key.pem ec2-user@$public_dns 'ls -la'

   # Terminate the instance
   aws ec2 terminate-instances --instance-ids $instance_id
   ```

   In this example, the Bash script uses the AWS CLI to automate the process of creating a new EC2 instance, waiting for it to be running, retrieving its public DNS name, performing tests, and then terminating the instance.

2. **Example: Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) Pipeline (Jenkins Pipeline)**

   - **Description**: Automate the process of building, testing, and deploying a web application using Jenkins.

   - **Jenkins Pipeline Code (Jenkinsfile)**:

   ```groovy
   pipeline {
       agent any

       stages {
           stage('Build') {
               steps {
                   // Build the web application (e.g., using npm or other build tools)
                   sh 'npm install'
                   sh 'npm run build'
               }
           }

           stage('Test') {
               steps {
                   // Run automated tests (e.g., using Jest or other testing frameworks)
                   sh 'npm test'
               }
           }

           stage('Deploy') {
               steps {
                   // Deploy the application to a server (e.g., using SSH or other deployment methods)
                   sh 'scp -r ./dist/* user@server:/path/to/deployment/'
               }
           }
       }
   }
   ```

   In this example, the Jenkins Pipeline defines stages for building, testing, and deploying a web application. Each stage contains specific steps that Jenkins will execute as part of the CI/CD process.

3. **Example: Backup and Restore Script (Bash)**

   - **Description**: Automate the process of backing up and restoring important files or databases.

   - **Bash Backup Script**:

   ```bash
   #!/bin/bash

   # Backup important files or databases
   tar -czvf backup.tar.gz /path/to/important/files

   # Copy backup to a remote server for storage (example using scp)
   scp backup.tar.gz user@remote-server:/path/to/backup/storage
   ```

   **Bash Restore Script**:

   ```bash
   #!/bin/bash

   # Restore backup from remote server (example using scp)
   scp user@remote-server:/path/to/backup/storage/backup.tar.gz .

   # Extract backup
   tar -xzvf backup.tar.gz -C /path/to/restore/location
   ```

   These scripts automate the process of creating backups, storing them on a remote server, and restoring them when needed.

These examples demonstrate tests for system administration and DevOps, including automated server provisioning in AWS, a Jenkins CI/CD pipeline, and backup/restore scripts. The provided code or instructions illustrate how to automate various tasks in a system or cloud environment.
