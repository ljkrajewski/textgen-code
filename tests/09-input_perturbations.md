## Input Perturbations
Input perturbations are used to test the robustness of machine learning models against adversarial attacks. Here are three specific examples of input perturbations for adversarial tests, along with sample code or instructions:

1. **Example: Adversarial Input Generation for Image Classification (Python with TensorFlow and CleverHans)**

   - **Description**: Generate adversarial examples to test the robustness of an image classification model against small perturbations.
   - **Sample prompt**: ```Write an example python script to test the robustness of an image classification model against small perturbations.```
   - **Test Code (Python with TensorFlow and CleverHans)**:

   To test the robustness of an image classification model against small perturbations, you can use techniques such as adding Gaussian noise, making slight rotations, or applying small translations to the images. Here's an example Python script that demonstrates this:

   - Load an image classification model (e.g., a pre-trained model from Keras).
   - Load a sample image.
   - Apply small perturbations to the image.
   - Predict the class of the original and perturbed images.
   - Compare the predictions.

   ```python
   import numpy as np
   import tensorflow as tf
   from tensorflow.keras.applications import MobileNetV2
   from tensorflow.keras.applications.mobilenet_v2 import preprocess_input, decode_predictions
   from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing import image
   import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
   import cv2
   
   # Load the pre-trained model
   model = MobileNetV2(weights='imagenet')
   
   # Load and preprocess an image
   img_path = 'elephant.jpg'  # Replace with the path to your image
   img = image.load_img(img_path, target_size=(224, 224))
   img_array = image.img_to_array(img)
   img_array = np.expand_dims(img_array, axis=0)
   img_array = preprocess_input(img_array)
   
   # Function to add Gaussian noise to the image
   def add_gaussian_noise(img_array, mean=0, stddev=0.1):
       noise = np.random.normal(mean, stddev, img_array.shape)
       noisy_img = img_array + noise
       return np.clip(noisy_img, 0, 255)
   
   # Function to slightly rotate the image
   def rotate_image(img_array, angle=5):
       h, w = img_array.shape[1:3]
       M = cv2.getRotationMatrix2D((w/2, h/2), angle, 1)
       rotated_img = cv2.warpAffine(img_array[0], M, (w, h))
       return np.expand_dims(rotated_img, axis=0)
   
   # Function to translate the image
   def translate_image(img_array, tx=5, ty=5):
       h, w = img_array.shape[1:3]
       M = np.float32([[1, 0, tx], [0, 1, ty]])
       translated_img = cv2.warpAffine(img_array[0], M, (w, h))
       return np.expand_dims(translated_img, axis=0)
   
   # Original prediction
   original_pred = model.predict(img_array)
   print('Original Prediction:', decode_predictions(original_pred, top=1)[0])
   
   # Perturbations
   perturbed_images = {
       'Gaussian Noise': add_gaussian_noise(img_array),
       'Rotation': rotate_image(img_array),
       'Translation': translate_image(img_array)
   }
   
   # Predictions on perturbed images
   for perturbation, perturbed_img in perturbed_images.items():
       perturbed_pred = model.predict(perturbed_img)
       print(f'{perturbation} Prediction:', decode_predictions(perturbed_pred, top=1)[0])
   
   # Display original and perturbed images
   plt.figure(figsize=(10, 5))
   
   plt.subplot(1, 4, 1)
   plt.title('Original')
   plt.imshow(img)
   
   for i, (perturbation, perturbed_img) in enumerate(perturbed_images.items(), start=2):
       plt.subplot(1, 4, i)
       plt.title(perturbation)
       plt.imshow(perturbed_img[0].astype('uint8'))
   
   plt.tight_layout()
   plt.show()
   ```
   In this script:
   - The MobileNetV2 model is used for image classification.
   - A sample image is loaded and preprocessed.
   - Small perturbations (Gaussian noise, rotation, and translation) are applied to the image.
   - The model's predictions for the original and perturbed images are compared.
   - The original and perturbed images are displayed for visual inspection.
   - This process helps evaluate the robustness of the model against small changes in the input data.

   In this example, we use CleverHans to generate adversarial examples using the Fast Gradient Method. The generated adversarial images are then used to evaluate the model's performance.

2. **Example: Text Classification with Adversarial Perturbations (Python with TextAttack)**

   - **Description**: Generate adversarial text examples to test the robustness of a text classification model.
   - **Sample prompt**: ```Write an example python script to generate adversarial text examples to test the robustness of a text classification model.```
   - **Test Code (Python with TextAttack)**:

   ```python
   import random
   import nltk
   from nltk.corpus import wordnet
   nltk.download('wordnet')
   
   def get_synonyms(word):
       synonyms = []
       for syn in wordnet.synsets(word):
           for lemma in syn.lemmas():
               synonyms.append(lemma.name())
       return list(set(synonyms))
   
   def generate_adversarial_example(text, n_changes=3):
       words = text.split()
       for _ in range(n_changes):
           idx = random.randint(0, len(words) - 1)
           word = words[idx]
           synonyms = get_synonyms(word)
           if synonyms:
               words[idx] = random.choice(synonyms)
       return ' '.join(words)
   
   def main():
       original_texts = [
           "This movie was great and I enjoyed it a lot.",
           "The service at this restaurant was terrible.",
           "I'm feeling happy today because the weather is nice."
       ]
       
       print("Original texts:")
       for text in original_texts:
           print(f"- {text}")
       
       print("\nAdversarial examples:")
       for text in original_texts:
           adversarial_text = generate_adversarial_example(text)
           print(f"- {adversarial_text}")
   
   if __name__ == "__main__":
       main()
   ```

   This script creates adversarial examples by replacing random words with their synonyms, which can be used to test the robustness of a text classification model. The adversarial examples should have similar meanings to the original texts but with different word choices, potentially challenging the model's ability to classify them correctly.

3. **Example: Speech Recognition with Adversarial Noise (Python with Adversarial Robustness Toolbox)**

   - **Description**: Add adversarial noise to audio input to test the robustness of a speech recognition model.
   - **Sample prompt**: ```Write an example python script to add adversarial noise to audio input to test the robustness of a speech recognition model.```
   - **Test Code (Python with Adversarial Robustness Toolbox)**:

   ```python
   # Upload audio file to 'perterb'
   from google.colab import files
   uploaded = files.upload()
   for fn in uploaded.keys():
     print('User uploaded file "{name}" with length {length} bytes'.format(
         name=fn, length=len(uploaded[fn])))
   
   import numpy as np
   import librosa
   import soundfile as sf
   from scipy import signal
   
   def add_adversarial_noise(audio_path, output_path, epsilon=0.1):
       # Load the audio file
       audio, sr = librosa.load(audio_path, sr=None)
       
       # Generate adversarial noise
       noise = np.random.normal(0, 1, size=audio.shape)
       
       # Normalize the noise
       noise = noise / np.linalg.norm(noise)
       
       # Scale the noise by epsilon
       scaled_noise = epsilon * noise
       
       # Add the scaled noise to the original audio
       adversarial_audio = audio + scaled_noise
       
       # Clip the audio to the valid range [-1, 1]
       adversarial_audio = np.clip(adversarial_audio, -1, 1)
       
       # Save the adversarial audio
       sf.write(output_path, adversarial_audio, sr)
       
       return adversarial_audio
   
   # Example usage
   input_audio = "/content/"+fn
   output_audio = "/content/adversarial_audio.wav"
   epsilon = 10.0  # Adjust this value to control the strength of the adversarial noise
   
   adversarial_sample = add_adversarial_noise(input_audio, output_audio, epsilon)
   
   print(f"Adversarial audio saved to: {output_audio}")
   ```

   This script adds untargeted adversarial noise to the audio. The noise is random and not specifically designed to cause misclassification in any particular direction. For more sophisticated attacks, you might want to use gradient-based methods that specifically optimize the noise to cause misclassification while minimizing the perturbation.
   
   To test the robustness of a speech recognition model, you would run this adversarial audio through your model and compare the results with the original audio. A robust model should ideally produce similar results for both the original and adversarial audio.
   
   Remember that the effectiveness of this simple approach may vary, and more advanced techniques might be necessary depending on your specific use case and the complexity of the speech recognition model you're testing.

These examples demonstrate how to perform adversarial tests using input perturbations for image classification, text classification, and speech recognition. The provided code can be used as a starting point and customized based on specific requirements and models used.
