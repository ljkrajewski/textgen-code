Input perturbations are used to test the robustness of machine learning models against adversarial attacks. Here are three specific examples of input perturbations for adversarial tests, along with sample code or instructions:

1. **Example: Adversarial Input Generation for Image Classification (Python with TensorFlow and CleverHans)**

   - **Description**: Generate adversarial examples to test the robustness of an image classification model against small perturbations.

   - **Test Code (Python with TensorFlow and CleverHans)**:

   Install TensorFlow and CleverHans using `pip install tensorflow cleverhans`.

   ```python
   import tensorflow as tf
   from cleverhans.attacks import FastGradientMethod
   from cleverhans.utils_keras import KerasModelWrapper
   from tensorflow.keras.applications import ResNet50

   # Load a pre-trained image classification model (e.g., ResNet50)
   model = ResNet50(weights='imagenet')

   # Wrap the model using KerasModelWrapper from CleverHans
   keras_model = KerasModelWrapper(model)

   # Create an attack object (e.g., Fast Gradient Method)
   fgsm = FastGradientMethod(keras_model, sess=tf.compat.v1.Session())

   # Generate adversarial examples
   adv_x = fgsm.generate(x, eps=0.1, clip_min=0.0, clip_max=1.0)

   # Test the model's performance on adversarial examples
   adv_predictions = model.predict(adv_x)
   ```

   In this example, we use CleverHans to generate adversarial examples using the Fast Gradient Method. The generated adversarial images are then used to evaluate the model's performance.

2. **Example: Text Classification with Adversarial Perturbations (Python with TextAttack)**

   - **Description**: Generate adversarial text examples to test the robustness of a text classification model.

   - **Test Code (Python with TextAttack)**:

   Install TextAttack using `pip install textattack`.

   ```python
   from textattack.attack_recipes import BAEGarg2019

   # Load a pre-trained text classification model (e.g., BERT)
   model = ...

   # Choose an attack recipe (e.g., BAEGarg2019)
   attack = BAEGarg2019.build(model)

   # Set the goal (e.g., misclassification)
   goal_function = ...

   # Generate adversarial examples
   adversarial_examples = attack.attack(goal_function, dataset)

   # Test the model's performance on adversarial examples
   for example in adversarial_examples:
       prediction = model.predict(example.original_text)
       adv_prediction = model.predict(example.perturbed_text)
   ```

   In this example, we use TextAttack to perform adversarial attacks on text classification models. The BAEGarg2019 attack recipe is used to generate adversarial examples.

3. **Example: Speech Recognition with Adversarial Noise (Python with Adversarial Robustness Toolbox)**

   - **Description**: Add adversarial noise to audio input to test the robustness of a speech recognition model.

   - **Test Code (Python with Adversarial Robustness Toolbox)**:

   Install Adversarial Robustness Toolbox using `pip install adversarial-robustness-toolbox`.

   ```python
   from art.attacks import AudioAdversarial

   # Load a pre-trained speech recognition model
   model = ...

   # Choose an attack (e.g., AudioAdversarial)
   attack = AudioAdversarial(model)

   # Generate adversarial noise
   adv_noise = attack.generate(x)

   # Add the adversarial noise to the input audio
   adv_audio = x + adv_noise

   # Test the model's performance on adversarial audio
   prediction = model.predict(adv_audio)
   ```

   In this example, we use the Adversarial Robustness Toolbox (ART) to generate adversarial noise and apply it to audio input for speech recognition. The adversarial audio is then used to evaluate the model's performance.

These examples demonstrate how to perform adversarial tests using input perturbations for image classification, text classification, and speech recognition. The provided code can be used as a starting point and customized based on specific requirements and models used.
