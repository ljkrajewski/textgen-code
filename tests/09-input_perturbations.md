Input perturbations are used to test the robustness of machine learning models against adversarial attacks. Here are three specific examples of input perturbations for adversarial tests, along with sample code or instructions:

1. **Example: Adversarial Input Generation for Image Classification (Python with TensorFlow and CleverHans)**

   - **Description**: Generate adversarial examples to test the robustness of an image classification model against small perturbations.
   - **Sample prompt**: ```Write an example python script to test the robustness of an image classification model against small perturbations.```
   - **Test Code (Python with TensorFlow and CleverHans)**:

   To test the robustness of an image classification model against small perturbations, you can use techniques such as adding Gaussian noise, making slight rotations, or applying small translations to the images. Here's an example Python script that demonstrates this:

   - Load an image classification model (e.g., a pre-trained model from Keras).
   - Load a sample image.
   - Apply small perturbations to the image.
   - Predict the class of the original and perturbed images.
   - Compare the predictions.

   ```python
   import numpy as np
   import tensorflow as tf
   from tensorflow.keras.applications import MobileNetV2
   from tensorflow.keras.applications.mobilenet_v2 import preprocess_input, decode_predictions
   from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing import image
   import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
   import cv2
   
   # Load the pre-trained model
   model = MobileNetV2(weights='imagenet')
   
   # Load and preprocess an image
   img_path = 'elephant.jpg'  # Replace with the path to your image
   img = image.load_img(img_path, target_size=(224, 224))
   img_array = image.img_to_array(img)
   img_array = np.expand_dims(img_array, axis=0)
   img_array = preprocess_input(img_array)
   
   # Function to add Gaussian noise to the image
   def add_gaussian_noise(img_array, mean=0, stddev=0.1):
       noise = np.random.normal(mean, stddev, img_array.shape)
       noisy_img = img_array + noise
       return np.clip(noisy_img, 0, 255)
   
   # Function to slightly rotate the image
   def rotate_image(img_array, angle=5):
       h, w = img_array.shape[1:3]
       M = cv2.getRotationMatrix2D((w/2, h/2), angle, 1)
       rotated_img = cv2.warpAffine(img_array[0], M, (w, h))
       return np.expand_dims(rotated_img, axis=0)
   
   # Function to translate the image
   def translate_image(img_array, tx=5, ty=5):
       h, w = img_array.shape[1:3]
       M = np.float32([[1, 0, tx], [0, 1, ty]])
       translated_img = cv2.warpAffine(img_array[0], M, (w, h))
       return np.expand_dims(translated_img, axis=0)
   
   # Original prediction
   original_pred = model.predict(img_array)
   print('Original Prediction:', decode_predictions(original_pred, top=1)[0])
   
   # Perturbations
   perturbed_images = {
       'Gaussian Noise': add_gaussian_noise(img_array),
       'Rotation': rotate_image(img_array),
       'Translation': translate_image(img_array)
   }
   
   # Predictions on perturbed images
   for perturbation, perturbed_img in perturbed_images.items():
       perturbed_pred = model.predict(perturbed_img)
       print(f'{perturbation} Prediction:', decode_predictions(perturbed_pred, top=1)[0])
   
   # Display original and perturbed images
   plt.figure(figsize=(10, 5))
   
   plt.subplot(1, 4, 1)
   plt.title('Original')
   plt.imshow(img)
   
   for i, (perturbation, perturbed_img) in enumerate(perturbed_images.items(), start=2):
       plt.subplot(1, 4, i)
       plt.title(perturbation)
       plt.imshow(perturbed_img[0].astype('uint8'))
   
   plt.tight_layout()
   plt.show()
   ```
   In this script:
   - The MobileNetV2 model is used for image classification.
   - A sample image is loaded and preprocessed.
   - Small perturbations (Gaussian noise, rotation, and translation) are applied to the image.
   - The model's predictions for the original and perturbed images are compared.
   - The original and perturbed images are displayed for visual inspection.
   - This process helps evaluate the robustness of the model against small changes in the input data.

   In this example, we use CleverHans to generate adversarial examples using the Fast Gradient Method. The generated adversarial images are then used to evaluate the model's performance.

2. **Example: Text Classification with Adversarial Perturbations (Python with TextAttack)**

   - **Description**: Generate adversarial text examples to test the robustness of a text classification model.
   - **Sample prompt**: ```Write an example python script to generate adversarial text examples to test the robustness of a text classification model.```
   - **Test Code (Python with TextAttack)**:

   Install TextAttack using `pip install textattack`.

   ```python
   from textattack.attack_recipes import BAEGarg2019

   # Load a pre-trained text classification model (e.g., BERT)
   model = ...

   # Choose an attack recipe (e.g., BAEGarg2019)
   attack = BAEGarg2019.build(model)

   # Set the goal (e.g., misclassification)
   goal_function = ...

   # Generate adversarial examples
   adversarial_examples = attack.attack(goal_function, dataset)

   # Test the model's performance on adversarial examples
   for example in adversarial_examples:
       prediction = model.predict(example.original_text)
       adv_prediction = model.predict(example.perturbed_text)
   ```

   In this example, we use TextAttack to perform adversarial attacks on text classification models. The BAEGarg2019 attack recipe is used to generate adversarial examples.

4. **Example: Speech Recognition with Adversarial Noise (Python with Adversarial Robustness Toolbox)**

   - **Description**: Add adversarial noise to audio input to test the robustness of a speech recognition model.
   - **Sample prompt**: 
   - **Test Code (Python with Adversarial Robustness Toolbox)**:

   Install Adversarial Robustness Toolbox using `pip install adversarial-robustness-toolbox`.

   ```python
   from art.attacks import AudioAdversarial

   # Load a pre-trained speech recognition model
   model = ...

   # Choose an attack (e.g., AudioAdversarial)
   attack = AudioAdversarial(model)

   # Generate adversarial noise
   adv_noise = attack.generate(x)

   # Add the adversarial noise to the input audio
   adv_audio = x + adv_noise

   # Test the model's performance on adversarial audio
   prediction = model.predict(adv_audio)
   ```

   In this example, we use the Adversarial Robustness Toolbox (ART) to generate adversarial noise and apply it to audio input for speech recognition. The adversarial audio is then used to evaluate the model's performance.

These examples demonstrate how to perform adversarial tests using input perturbations for image classification, text classification, and speech recognition. The provided code can be used as a starting point and customized based on specific requirements and models used.
