## Code Structure Tests for Code Quality and Style
Code structure tests assess how well-organized and modular the code is. Here are three specific examples of code structure tests for code quality and style, along with sample code or instructions:

1. **Example: Modularization and Function Decomposition (Python)**

   - **Description**: Evaluate if the code is properly modularized with well-defined functions that perform specific tasks.

   - **Test Code (Python)**:

   ```python
   def code_structure_test_modularization():
       def task_1():
           return "Task 1 completed"

       def task_2():
           return "Task 2 completed"

       def task_3():
           return "Task 3 completed"

       result_1 = task_1()
       result_2 = task_2()
       result_3 = task_3()

       assert result_1 == "Task 1 completed"
       assert result_2 == "Task 2 completed"
       assert result_3 == "Task 3 completed"
   ```

   In this example, we have a test that includes three separate functions (`task_1`, `task_2`, and `task_3`). Each function performs a specific task, and they are modularized for readability and reusability.

2. **Example: Class and Object Structure (Python)**

   - **Description**: Assess if the code utilizes classes and objects effectively to organize data and behavior.

   - **Test Code (Python)**:

   ```python
   class Person:
       def __init__(self, name, age):
           self.name = name
           self.age = age

       def introduce(self):
           return f"Hi, I'm {self.name} and I'm {self.age} years old."

   def code_structure_test_classes_objects():
       person1 = Person("Alice", 30)
       person2 = Person("Bob", 25)

       assert person1.introduce() == "Hi, I'm Alice and I'm 30 years old."
       assert person2.introduce() == "Hi, I'm Bob and I'm 25 years old."
   ```

   In this example, we have a `Person` class with attributes (`name` and `age`) and a method (`introduce`) to introduce the person. The test demonstrates the creation of two instances of the `Person` class.

3. **Example: Proper Use of Control Structures (Python)**

   - **Description**: Evaluate if control structures (e.g., loops, conditionals) are used appropriately and effectively.

   - **Test Code (Python)**:

   ```python
   def code_structure_test_control_structures():
       numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
       sum_of_even_numbers = 0

       for num in numbers:
           if num % 2 == 0:
               sum_of_even_numbers += num

       assert sum_of_even_numbers == 6
   ```

   In this example, we have a test that demonstrates the use of a `for` loop and an `if` statement to calculate the sum of even numbers in a list.

These examples highlight code structure tests that focus on modularization, class and object organization, and proper use of control structures. A well-organized code structure contributes to readability, maintainability, and extensibility of the codebase.
