## Code Readability Tests for Code Quality and Style
Code readability tests focus on evaluating how well-written and understandable the code is. Here are three specific examples of code readability tests for code quality and style, along with sample code or instructions:

1. **Example: Consistent Indentation (Python)**

   - **Description**: Ensure that the code uses consistent indentation for blocks of code.  
   - **Sample Prompt**: There is no sample prompt for this example. Generated code will need to be manually reviewed to ensure proper indentation.
   - **Test Code (Python)**:  
   This code is an example of correct and incorrect code indentaion. It is _not_ working code.
   ```python
   def code_readability_test_indentation():
       def function_with_inconsistent_indentation():
           print("This function has inconsistent indentation.")
          print("It should use spaces for indentation, not tabs.")  # Incorrect indentation

       def function_with_correct_indentation():
           print("This function has correct indentation.")
           print("It uses spaces for indentation consistently.")  # Correct indentation

       function_with_inconsistent_indentation()
       function_with_correct_indentation()
   ```

   In this example, we have a test that includes two nested functions. The first function intentionally uses inconsistent indentation to highlight the importance of consistent formatting. The second function demonstrates correct indentation.

2. **Example: Meaningful Variable and Function Names (Python)**

   - **Description**: Evaluate if variable and function names are descriptive and convey their purpose.

   - **Test Code (Python)**:

   ```python
   def code_readability_test_meaningful_names():
       def a_function_with_non_descriptive_name():
           non_meaningful_variable = 42
           return non_meaningful_variable

       def a_function_with_descriptive_name():
           meaningful_variable = 42
           return meaningful_variable

       result_1 = a_function_with_non_descriptive_name()
       result_2 = a_function_with_descriptive_name()

       assert result_1 == result_2
   ```

   In this example, we have two functions. The first function uses non-descriptive variable names (`non_meaningful_variable`) and a non-descriptive function name (`a_function_with_non_descriptive_name`). The second function uses meaningful variable names (`meaningful_variable`) and a descriptive function name (`a_function_with_descriptive_name`).

3. **Example: Proper Comments and Documentation (Python)**

   - **Description**: Assess if the code includes appropriate comments and documentation to explain complex or non-intuitive sections.

   - **Test Code (Python)**:

   ```python
   def code_readability_test_comments_and_documentation():
       # This is a poorly documented function.
       # It's not clear what it does and why.
       def poorly_documented_function(x, y):
           return x * y

       # This is a well-documented function.
       # It multiplies two numbers and returns the result.
       def well_documented_function(x, y):
           """
           Multiply two numbers and return the result.

           Args:
               x (int): The first number.
               y (int): The second number.

           Returns:
               int: The result of multiplying x and y.
           """
           return x * y

       result_1 = poorly_documented_function(2, 3)
       result_2 = well_documented_function(2, 3)

       assert result_1 == result_2
   ```

   In this example, we have two functions. The first function (`poorly_documented_function`) lacks proper comments and documentation, making it unclear what it does. The second function (`well_documented_function`) includes a docstring that provides clear information about its purpose, arguments, and return value.

These examples demonstrate code readability tests that focus on consistent indentation, meaningful variable and function names, and proper comments/documentation. These aspects contribute to the overall quality and maintainability of the code.
