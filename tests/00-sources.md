# Researching LLM Sources
1. Most LLM models are hosted on [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/models).
2. Each model on Hugging Face has a model card (for example, [mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2](https://huggingface.co/mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2)) that may information on how the model was generated. (training sets used, LLMs merged, etc.)
