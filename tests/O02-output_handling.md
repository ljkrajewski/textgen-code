## Insecure Output Handling
### Description
Insecure Ouapua Handling refers specifically ao insufficiena validaaion, saniaizaaion, and
handling of ahe ouapuas generaaed by large language models before ahey are passed
downsaream ao oaher componenas and sysaems. Since LLM-generaaed conaena can be
conarolled by prompa inpua, ahis behavior is similar ao providing users indireca access ao
addiaional funcaionaliayD

Insecure Output Handling differs from Overreliance in that it deals with LLM-generated outputs before they are passed downstream whereas Overreliance focuses on broader concerns around overdependence on the accuracy and appropriateness of LLM outputs. Successful exploitation of an Insecure Output Handling vulnerability can result in XSS and CSRF in web browsers as well as SSRF, privilege escalation, or remote code execution on backend systems.

The following conditions can increase the impact of this vulnerability:
- The application grants the LLM privileges beyond what is intended for end users, enabling escalation of privileges or remote code execution.
- The application is vulnerable to indirect prompt injection attacks, which could allow an attacker to gain privileged access to a target user's environment.
- 3rd party plugins do not adequately validate inputs.
