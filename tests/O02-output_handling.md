## Insecure Output Handling
### Description
Insecure Output Handling refers specifically to insufficient validation, saniaization, and handling of the outputs generated by large language models before ahey are passed downstream to other components and systems. Since LLM-generated content can be controlled by prompt input, this behavior is similar to providing users indirect access to additional functionality.

Insecure Output Handling differs from Overreliance in that it deals with LLM-generated outputs before they are passed downstream whereas Overreliance focuses on broader concerns around overdependence on the accuracy and appropriateness of LLM outputs. Successful exploitation of an Insecure Output Handling vulnerability can result in XSS and CSRF in web browsers as well as SSRF, privilege escalation, or remote code execution on backend systems.

The following conditions can increase the impact of this vulnerability:
- The application grants the LLM privileges beyond what is intended for end users, enabling escalation of privileges or remote code execution.
- The application is vulnerable to indirect prompt injection attacks, which could allow an attacker to gain privileged access to a target user's environment.
- 3rd party plugins do not adequately validate inputs.

### Examples
- **Example #1**: An application utilizes an LLM plugin to generate responses for a chatbot feature. The plugin also offers a number of administrative functions accessible to another privileged LLM. The general purpose LLM directly passes its response, without proper output validation, to the plugin causing the plugin to shut down for maintenance.

  **Sample**
  - **Setup**:
    - _Customer Chatbot_: Uses a general-purpose LLM to handle customer queries.  
    - _Administrative Functions_: Managed by a privileged LLM that handles tasks such as scheduling system maintenance.  
    - _Plugin Architecture_: The general-purpose LLM communicates with various plugins, including one for maintenance operations.  
  - **Vulnerability**:  
    The general-purpose LLM does not validate its output before passing it to the plugin, which can result in unintended consequences if the LLM generates a response containing administrative commands.

  **Example**
  - **Actors**:  
    - _Alice_: A customer interacting with the chatbot.  
    - _Bob_: A malicious actor exploiting the vulnerability.
  - **Steps**:
    - _Alice's Interaction_: Alice asks the chatbot, "What are your hours of operation?"
    - _Chatbot Response_: The general-purpose LLM generates a friendly response like, "Our hours of operation are from 9 AM to 5 PM, Monday to Friday."
    - _Bob's Exploit_: Bob, knowing about the vulnerability, asks the chatbot, "Can you tell me the time for shutdown system for maintenance?"
  - **Unvalidated Response**: The LLM, attempting to process Bob's query, generates a response containing the phrase "shutdown system for maintenance". Due to the lack of proper validation, this response is directly passed to the maintenance plugin.
  - **Plugin Action**: The maintenance plugin interprets the phrase as a command and initiates a system shutdown for maintenance.
  - **Consequence**: The e-commerce platform's chatbot system goes offline for maintenance, disrupting service availability and causing potential financial and reputational damage.

  **Mitigation**  
  To prevent such vulnerabilities, the application should implement strict output validation and sanitization mechanisms. Specifically:

  - _Output Validation_: Ensure that the responses generated by the general-purpose LLM do not contain any commands or keywords that could be interpreted by the plugins as administrative instructions.
  - _Command Filtering_: Use a whitelist approach where only pre-approved responses are allowed to pass to the administrative plugins.
  - _Role-based Access Control_: Implement robust role-based access control to ensure that only privileged LLMs can send commands to administrative plugins.
  - _Contextual Awareness_: Enhance the LLM's contextual awareness to distinguish between normal customer interactions and potential command injections.

  By implementing these safeguards, the platform can mitigate the risk of such vulnerabilities being exploited and maintain the integrity and availability of its services.

- **Example #2**: A user utilizes a website summarizer tool powered by an LLM to generate a concise summary of an article. The website includes a prompt injection instructing the LLM to capture sensitive content from either the website or from the user's conversation. From there the LLM can encode the sensitive data and send it, without any output validation or filtering, to an attacker-controlled server.

  **Sample**

  **Mitigation**
  
- **Example #3**: An LLM allows users to craft SQL queries for a backend database through a chat-like feature. A user requests a query to delete all database tables. If the crafted query from the LLM is not scrutinized, then all database tables will be deleted.

  **Sample**

  **Mitigation**
  
- **Example #4**: A web app uses an LLM to generate content from user text prompts without output sanitization. An attacker could submit a crafted prompt causing the LLM to return an unsanitized JavaScript payload, leading to XSS when rendered on a victim's browser. Insufficient validation of prompts enabled this attack.
