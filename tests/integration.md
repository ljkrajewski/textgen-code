Integration tests focus on ensuring that different parts of a system work together correctly. Here are three specific examples of integration tests for correctness:

1. **Example: User Authentication in a Web Application**
   - **Description**: Test the interaction between the frontend and backend components for user authentication.
   - **Test Case**:
     - **Input**: Valid username and password
     - **Expected Output**: Successful login

   - **Integration Test Scenario**:
     1. Simulate a user entering valid credentials on the login page.
     2. Send the credentials to the server.
     3. Verify that the server returns a success status code (e.g., 200) and a session token.
     4. Check if the user is redirected to the dashboard page.

2. **Example: Database Integration for a Blogging Platform**
   - **Description**: Test the interaction between the application code and the database for creating and retrieving blog posts.
   - **Test Case**:
     - **Input**: New blog post content
     - **Expected Output**: Blog post successfully saved and retrievable

   - **Integration Test Scenario**:
     1. Use the application to create a new blog post.
     2. Query the database to check if the post was successfully inserted.
     3. Retrieve the post using the application's retrieval function.
     4. Verify that the retrieved post matches the originally created content.

3. **Example: E-commerce Checkout Process**
   - **Description**: Test the end-to-end flow of a checkout process, involving interactions between the shopping cart, payment gateway, and order processing system.
   - **Test Case**:
     - **Input**: Selected items in the cart, valid payment information
     - **Expected Output**: Order successfully placed and confirmed

   - **Integration Test Scenario**:
     1. Add items to the shopping cart.
     2. Proceed to the checkout process, providing valid payment information.
     3. Simulate interaction with the payment gateway API to process the payment.
     4. Check if an order is created in the system with the correct items and payment status.

In these examples, the integration tests simulate real-world interactions between different components or systems. They involve multiple steps and validate that the system behaves correctly when these components work together. These tests are crucial for ensuring that the entire system functions as expected in a holistic manner.
