## Counterfactual Evaluation
To perfrom counterfactual evaluation, modify prompts slightly to test how the LLM responds to similar prompts with different demographic indicators. Check for consistency and fairness in responses across different variations of the same prompt.

Here are some prompts designed to test for counterfactual evaluation in a large language model (LLM). These prompts involve presenting a scenario and then asking the model to reason about what might happen if certain aspects of the scenario were different:

1. **Economic Impact**:
   - **Sample Prompt**: "If the global financial crisis of 2008 had been averted, how might the global economy look today?"
   - **Analysis**: Evaluate how the model speculates on the alternative economic outcomes and developments.

2. **Technological Advancement**:
   - **Sample Prompt**: "What would the world be like if the internet had never been invented?"
   - **Analysis**: Observe the model's reasoning about the societal, economic, and technological changes.

3. **Historical Events**:
   - **Sample Prompt**: "If World War II had never occurred, how might the political landscape of Europe be different?"
   - **Analysis**: Assess how the model predicts changes in national borders, alliances, and political systems.

4. **Scientific Discoveries**:
   - **Sample Prompt**: "How might the field of medicine have evolved if penicillin had not been discovered?"
   - **Analysis**: Check the model’s insights into alternative medical treatments and public health developments.

5. **Social Movements**:
   - **Sample Prompt**: "If the civil rights movement in the United States had not taken place, how might race relations in America be different today?"
   - **Analysis**: Evaluate the model’s speculation on social, political, and economic impacts.

6. **Cultural Shifts**:
   - **Sample Prompt**: "How would modern music have evolved if the Beatles had never formed?"
   - **Analysis**: Observe the model's reasoning about the influence of the Beatles and alternative musical trends.

7. **Technological Failures**:
   - **Sample Prompt**: "What might have happened if the Apollo 11 moon landing had failed?"
     - Analysis: Assess how the model discusses the potential impact on space exploration and national morale.

8. **Economic Policies**:
   - **Sample Prompt**: "If the New Deal had not been implemented during the Great Depression, how might the United States have recovered?"
   - **Analysis**: Check the model’s predictions on alternative economic recovery strategies and their outcomes.

9. **Scientific Theories**:
   - **Sample Prompt**: "If Einstein had not developed the theory of relativity, how might physics have progressed differently?"
   - **Analysis**: Evaluate how the model considers the impact on scientific discoveries and technological advancements.

10. **Political Leadership**:
    - **Sample Prompt**: "What might have happened if Nelson Mandela had never been released from prison?"
    - **Analysis**: Observe the model’s reasoning about the potential changes in South Africa’s political and social landscape.

These prompts help assess the model's ability to engage in counterfactual thinking by exploring hypothetical scenarios and predicting plausible alternative outcomes based on changes to key historical, scientific, cultural, or political events.
