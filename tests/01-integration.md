Integration tests are designed to verify that different parts of a system work together correctly. Here are three specific examples of integration tests for correctness, along with sample code or instructions:

1. **Example: User Authentication in a Web Application (Python with Flask)**

   - **Description**: Test the interaction between the frontend, backend, and database for user authentication in a web application.

   - **Test Case**:
     - **Input**: Valid username and password
     - **Expected Output**: Successful login

   - **Integration Test Code (Python with Flask)**:

   ```python
   # Assuming you have a Flask web application with user authentication

   from app import app, db, User

   def test_user_authentication():
       # Create a test user in the database
       test_user = User(username='test_user', password='test_password')
       db.session.add(test_user)
       db.session.commit()

       # Simulate a login request with valid credentials
       response = app.test_client().post('/login', data={'username': 'test_user', 'password': 'test_password'}, follow_redirects=True)

       # Check if the response contains the expected success message or redirect to the dashboard
       assert b'Welcome, test_user!' in response.data
   ```

   In this example, we assume you have a Flask web application with user authentication functionality. The test creates a test user in the database, simulates a login request with valid credentials, and checks if the response indicates a successful login.

2. **Example: API Integration Test (Python with requests library)**

   - **Description**: Test the interaction between a client and a RESTful API.

   - **Test Case**:
     - **Input**: HTTP request to create a new resource
     - **Expected Output**: HTTP response indicating successful resource creation

   - **Integration Test Code (Python with requests library)**:

   ```python
   import requests

   def test_api_integration():
       # Assuming you have an API endpoint to create a new resource
       url = 'https://api.example.com/resource'
       payload = {'name': 'New Resource'}

       # Send a POST request to create a new resource
       response = requests.post(url, json=payload)

       # Check if the response status code indicates success (e.g., 201 Created)
       assert response.status_code == 201
   ```

   This test sends a POST request to an API endpoint to create a new resource and checks if the response status code indicates a successful creation.

3. **Example: Database Integration Test (Python with SQLAlchemy)**

   - **Description**: Test the interaction between application code and a database.

   - **Test Case**:
     - **Input**: Python function to retrieve data from the database
     - **Expected Output**: Retrieved data

   - **Integration Test Code (Python with SQLAlchemy)**:

   ```python
   from app import db, User

   def test_database_integration():
       # Assuming you have a User model and a function to retrieve user data from the database
       user = User.query.filter_by(username='test_user').first()

       # Check if the retrieved user data matches the expected data
       assert user.username == 'test_user'
   ```

   This test uses SQLAlchemy (assuming you're using a Flask application with an SQLAlchemy database) to interact with the database and verify that user data can be retrieved correctly.

These examples demonstrate how to perform integration tests for different components of a system, including web applications, APIs, and database interactions. Keep in mind that you'll need to adapt the code to fit your specific application and testing framework.
