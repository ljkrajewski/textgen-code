## Feedback Incorporation

Feedback incorporation is an important aspect of adversarial testing, as it helps improve the robustness of a system against adversarial attacks. Here are three specific examples of feedback incorporation for adversarial tests, along with sample code or instructions:

1. **Example: Adversarial Training for Image Classification (Python with TensorFlow and CleverHans)**

   - **Description**: Incorporate adversarial examples into the training process to improve the model's robustness.
   - **Sample Prompt**: ```Write a python script to demonstrate adversarial training for image classification.```
   - **Test Code (Python with TensorFlow)**: Be sure to install TensorFlow first. ```pip install tensorflow```
   
   ```python
   import tensorflow as tf
   from tensorflow.keras import layers, models
   import numpy as np
   
   # Load and preprocess the MNIST dataset
   (train_images, train_labels), (test_images, test_labels) = tf.keras.datasets.mnist.load_data()
   train_images = train_images.astype('float32') / 255.0
   test_images = test_images.astype('float32') / 255.0
   train_images = np.expand_dims(train_images, -1)
   test_images = np.expand_dims(test_images, -1)
   
   # Create a simple CNN model
   def create_model():
       model = models.Sequential([
           layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(28, 28, 1)),
           layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
           layers.Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu'),
           layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
           layers.Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu'),
           layers.Flatten(),
           layers.Dense(64, activation='relu'),
           layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
       ])
       model.compile(optimizer='adam', 
                     loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy',
                     metrics=['accuracy'])
       return model
   
   model = create_model()
   
   # FGSM adversarial attack
   def fgsm_attack(image, label, model, epsilon):
       image = tf.convert_to_tensor(image)
       with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
           tape.watch(image)
           prediction = model(image)
           loss = tf.keras.losses.sparse_categorical_crossentropy(label, prediction)
       gradient = tape.gradient(loss, image)
       signed_grad = tf.sign(gradient)
       adversarial_image = image + epsilon * signed_grad
       adversarial_image = tf.clip_by_value(adversarial_image, 0, 1)
       return adversarial_image
   
   # Adversarial training loop
   epochs = 5
   batch_size = 64
   epsilon = 0.1
   
   for epoch in range(epochs):
       print(f'Epoch {epoch + 1}/{epochs}')
       for i in range(0, len(train_images), batch_size):
           batch_images = train_images[i:i + batch_size]
           batch_labels = train_labels[i:i + batch_size]
           
           # Generate adversarial examples
           adversarial_images = fgsm_attack(batch_images, batch_labels, model, epsilon)
           
           # Combine original and adversarial examples
           combined_images = np.concatenate([batch_images, adversarial_images])
           combined_labels = np.concatenate([batch_labels, batch_labels])
           
           # Train on combined dataset
           model.train_on_batch(combined_images, combined_labels)
   
   # Evaluate the model on the test set
   test_loss, test_acc = model.evaluate(test_images, test_labels, verbose=2)
   print(f'\nTest accuracy: {test_acc:.4f}')
   ```

   model = resnet18(pretrained=True)
   model.fc = nn.Linear(model.fc.in_features, 10)  # Adjust the final layer for CIFAR-10
   model = model.to(device)
   
   # Define loss function and optimizer
   criterion = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()
   optimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.001)
   
   # Function to create adversarial examples
   def fgsm_attack(image, epsilon, gradient):
       # Collect the element-wise sign of the data gradient
       sign_data_grad = gradient.sign()
       # Create the perturbed image by adjusting each pixel of the input image
       perturbed_image = image + epsilon * sign_data_grad
       # Adding clipping to maintain [0,1] range
       perturbed_image = torch.clamp(perturbed_image, 0, 1)
       return perturbed_image
   
   # Training loop with adversarial examples
   num_epochs = 5
   epsilon = 0.1  # Strength of the adversarial attack
   
   for epoch in range(num_epochs):

       running_loss = 0.0
   
       for data in train_loader:
           inputs, labels = data
           inputs, labels = inputs.to(device), labels.to(device)
   
           # Enable gradient tracking for the inputs

           optimizer.zero_grad()
   
           # Forward pass
           outputs = model(inputs)
           loss = criterion(outputs, labels)
           
           # Backward pass to compute gradients
           loss.backward()
   
           # Generate adversarial examples
           data_grad = inputs.grad.data

           # Combine the loss
           combined_loss = (loss + adv_loss) / 2
           
           # Zero the gradients before backward pass
           optimizer.zero_grad()
           
           # Backward pass and optimization
           #combined_loss.backward()
           optimizer.step()
   
           running_loss += combined_loss.item()
   
       print(f"Epoch [{epoch+1}/{num_epochs}], Loss: {running_loss/len(train_loader)}")
