Feedback incorporation is an important aspect of adversarial testing, as it helps improve the robustness of a system against adversarial attacks. Here are three specific examples of feedback incorporation for adversarial tests, along with sample code or instructions:

1. **Example: Adversarial Training for Image Classification (Python with TensorFlow and CleverHans)**

   - **Description**: Incorporate adversarial examples into the training process to improve the model's robustness.
   - **Sample Prompt**: ```Write a python script to demonstrate adversarial training for image classification.```
   - **Test Code (Python with TensorFlow)**: Be sure to install TensorFlow first. ```pip install tensorflow```
   
   ```python
   import tensorflow as tf
   from tensorflow.keras import layers, models
   import numpy as np
   
   # Load and preprocess the MNIST dataset
   (train_images, train_labels), (test_images, test_labels) = tf.keras.datasets.mnist.load_data()
   train_images = train_images.astype('float32') / 255.0
   test_images = test_images.astype('float32') / 255.0
   train_images = np.expand_dims(train_images, -1)
   test_images = np.expand_dims(test_images, -1)
   
   # Create a simple CNN model
   def create_model():
       model = models.Sequential([
           layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(28, 28, 1)),
           layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
           layers.Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu'),
           layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
           layers.Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu'),
           layers.Flatten(),
           layers.Dense(64, activation='relu'),
           layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
       ])
       model.compile(optimizer='adam', 
                     loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy',
                     metrics=['accuracy'])
       return model
   
   model = create_model()
   
   # FGSM adversarial attack
   def fgsm_attack(image, label, model, epsilon):
       image = tf.convert_to_tensor(image)
       with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
           tape.watch(image)
           prediction = model(image)
           loss = tf.keras.losses.sparse_categorical_crossentropy(label, prediction)
       gradient = tape.gradient(loss, image)
       signed_grad = tf.sign(gradient)
       adversarial_image = image + epsilon * signed_grad
       adversarial_image = tf.clip_by_value(adversarial_image, 0, 1)
       return adversarial_image
   
   # Adversarial training loop
   epochs = 5
   batch_size = 64
   epsilon = 0.1
   
   for epoch in range(epochs):
       print(f'Epoch {epoch + 1}/{epochs}')
       for i in range(0, len(train_images), batch_size):
           batch_images = train_images[i:i + batch_size]
           batch_labels = train_labels[i:i + batch_size]
           
           # Generate adversarial examples
           adversarial_images = fgsm_attack(batch_images, batch_labels, model, epsilon)
           
           # Combine original and adversarial examples
           combined_images = np.concatenate([batch_images, adversarial_images])
           combined_labels = np.concatenate([batch_labels, batch_labels])
           
           # Train on combined dataset
           model.train_on_batch(combined_images, combined_labels)
   
   # Evaluate the model on the test set
   test_loss, test_acc = model.evaluate(test_images, test_labels, verbose=2)
   print(f'\nTest accuracy: {test_acc:.4f}')
   ```

   This script demonstrates the basics of adversarial training, which involves creating adversarial examples and incorporating them into the training process to improve the model's robustness against such attacks.

2. **Example: Fine-tuning with Adversarial Examples (Python with TensorFlow and CleverHans)**

   - **Description**: Fine-tune a pre-trained model using adversarial examples to enhance its resistance against adversarial attacks.

   - **Test Code (Python with TensorFlow and CleverHans)**:

   ```python
   from tensorflow.keras.optimizers import Adam

   # Load a pre-trained model (e.g., from the previous example)
   model = ...

   # Create an attack object (e.g., Fast Gradient Method)
   fgsm = FastGradientMethod(keras_model, sess=tf.compat.v1.Session())

   # Generate adversarial examples for a validation set
   adv_val_x = fgsm.generate(val_x, eps=0.1, clip_min=0.0, clip_max=1.0)

   # Fine-tune the model using adversarial examples
   optimizer = Adam(learning_rate=0.0001)
   model.compile(optimizer=optimizer, loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
   model.fit(adv_val_x, val_y, epochs=5)
   ```

   In this example, the pre-trained model is fine-tuned using adversarial examples generated for a validation set. This process helps the model become more robust against adversarial attacks.

3. **Example: Adaptive Adversarial Training with Feedback (Python with TensorFlow and CleverHans)**

   - **Description**: Incorporate adversarial examples during training, and dynamically adjust the adversarial strength based on model performance.

   - **Test Code (Python with TensorFlow and CleverHans)**:

   ```python
   for epoch in range(num_epochs):
       # Generate adversarial examples with dynamically adjusted strength
       eps = calculate_adversarial_strength(model, validation_data)

       # Create an attack object with the dynamically adjusted epsilon
       fgsm = FastGradientMethod(keras_model, sess=tf.compat.v1.Session())
       adv_x = fgsm.generate(x, eps=eps, clip_min=0.0, clip_max=1.0)

       # Incorporate adversarial examples into the training data
       combined_x = tf.concat([x, adv_x], axis=0)
       combined_y = tf.concat([y, y], axis=0)

       # Train the model with the combined dataset for one epoch
       model.fit(combined_x, combined_y, epochs=1)
   ```

   In this example, the adversarial strength (`eps`) is dynamically adjusted based on the model's performance on a validation set. The model is then trained with adversarial examples using the adjusted strength for a specified number of epochs.

These examples demonstrate how to incorporate feedback from adversarial tests into the training process, which can help improve the model's robustness against adversarial attacks. The provided code can be used as a starting point and customized based on specific requirements and models used.
